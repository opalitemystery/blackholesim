# Black Hole Photon Trajectory Simulator

A numerical simulation of photon trajectories near a black hole using general relativity.

## Current Phase
Phase 1 — Console-based null geodesic solver in Schwarzschild spacetime.

# Second Working Version Now Here!
This version does not have any crashes anymore! (according to my testing at least) I changed basically all of the physics from V1 because it used wrong physics and allowed for impossible conditions that wouldn't actually exist. 


## Core Features
- Null geodesic integration using an affine parameter
- Schwarzschild spacetime
- 2D plane restriction
- Physically accurate numerical methods
- Arbitrary photon directions
- Capture vs escape detection
- Basic visualization added, not interactive yet, still console input.

## Planned Extensions
- Kerr spacetime
- Interactive visualization
